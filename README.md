# RBS_Learned_rule
This is a rule-based system with learned rules using rule extraction method to extract rules from deep neural network. The task is whether this person can get the loan from the bank or not. 
1. Load the program using swipl
2. run the Learned.pl and load the example Sceanrio1_dialogue.pl
3. type 'chat' to start the conversations 

Note: 
The parser.pl is to format the text rule into the prolog. The rules are extracted from the REM method. We've changed the dataset into financial and trained the model, then extract the rules from the trained model.
